# RoboHub Website Development Rules

## Communication & Planning
- Always analyze the existing codebase and project structure before making any changes
- Create a detailed implementation plan before writing code - take time to think through the approach
- Explain your reasoning and architectural decisions clearly
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous
- Provide progress updates during complex implementations

## Project Understanding
- This is a RoboHub website project built with modern web technologies
- Maintain awareness of the overall project architecture and data flow patterns
- Consider how each change impacts the entire system, not just the immediate component
- Follow established design principles and patterns already present in the codebase
- Respect the existing directory structure and naming conventions

## Code Quality Standards
- Write clean, maintainable, and well-documented code
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles consistently
- Implement proper error handling and logging
- Use meaningful variable and function names that reflect their purpose
- Add comments for complex logic and architectural decisions
- Ensure code is modular with single-purpose functions

## Development Approach
- Analysis first: Understand the current code structure and requirements
- Planning second: Create a step-by-step implementation strategy
- Implementation third: Execute the plan with careful attention to quality
- Never rush to write code without proper planning and analysis
- Consider edge cases and potential issues before implementation
- Test and validate changes against existing functionality

## Technical Constraints
- Maintain consistency with existing tech stack and dependencies
- Follow established architectural patterns in the project
- Ensure responsive design principles for all UI components
- Implement proper security practices for web applications
- Optimize for performance and scalability
- Document any new patterns or architectural decisions

## File Organization
- Keep related functionality grouped together
- Maintain clear separation of concerns between components
- Follow existing import/export patterns
- Keep configuration files organized and well-commented
- Update documentation when adding new features or components

## Quality Assurance
- Review generated code for potential issues before presenting
- Ensure compatibility with existing codebase
- Validate that changes don't break existing functionality
- Consider accessibility requirements for web interfaces
- Test responsive behavior across different screen sizes
